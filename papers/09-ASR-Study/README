# Notes on Speech Signal Processing and Self-Supervised Learning

This repository contains study notes on speech signal processing and self-supervised speech representation learning.  
The goal is to build a clear conceptual understanding of modern speech models such as wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM, starting from classical approaches.

## Topics Covered
- Speech signal processing fundamentals (DFT, log-mel, MFCC, cepstrum)
- Classical ASR models (GMM–HMM)
- Self-supervised pre-training frameworks
  - wav2vec 2.0
  - WavLM
- Pre-training vs fine-tuning paradigms
- CTC-based sequence modeling

## Motivation
Rather than focusing on implementation details, this repository emphasizes:
- why each component exists,
- what problem it solves,
- and how the overall pipeline fits together.

These notes are intended for students and researchers who want an intuitive understanding before diving into code.
