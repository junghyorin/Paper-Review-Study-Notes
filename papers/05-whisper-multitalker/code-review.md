## Architecture Notes

The following diagram is **my own handwritten summary**
of the Whisper-Sidecar codebase structure,
created while reading the original implementation.

- It is NOT an official figure from the paper.
- It is NOT a copy of the original code.
- It reflects my personal understanding of the model flow,
  module interactions, and loss computation.
